1) for each two distinct points, there exists exactly one line on both of them.
1) a, c, d 
2) each line has two or fewer other lines of the geometry parallel to it.
2) a, b, c, d, e
3) through a point not on a given line, there is exactly one line parallel to the given line.
3) c, e
4) each point of the geometry lies on exactly three lines of the geometry
4) c, d, e, f
5) all the axioms are also true statements in ordinary euclidean geometry
5) none
6) changing the last axiom results in young's geometry
6) d
7) for each set of three points, there is exactly one line containing them.
7) none
8) if a point is not on a given line, then there is at least one point on the line not lying on any line through the given point
8) b, e, f 
9) the lines through each point in the geometry contain every point in the geometry
9) a, c, d
