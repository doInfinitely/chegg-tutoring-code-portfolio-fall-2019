a. To show that SES is in NP, it is sufficient to show that there is a polynomial time process that can verify a constructive proof of a YES-instance of SES. Given a set S of classes of size k, for each pair of classes C_i and C_j, i != j, verifying that they do not share a common student requires O(max(|C_i|, |C_j|)). Performing this operation between each unique pair of classes requires O(k^2) steps. Thus verifying an example solution to SES can be done in polynomial time. Due to the symmetries inherent in the polynomial time reduction of SES to clique and independent set, it can also be shown that a NO-instance can be verified in polynomial time
